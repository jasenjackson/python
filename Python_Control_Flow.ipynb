    "In this section, we'll learn about controlling and organizing your program. There are various methods for controlling program flow in python (which are similar if not identical to other languages). Firstly, you'll want to organize chunks of code into functions that \"do\" various thingss. Then you may want to do something over and over again until a certain point, or go through every item in a set of data. "

We'll learn more about control flow in the next notebook in this series, but right now let's talk about conditionals. If you want to control the direction a program is going, based on user response (or someother input) you will need what are called \"if\" statements, or conditionals. It allows the computer to receive directions the same way we do. \"If this happens\" then \"do this\". Look at the code below, to see how if-statements can bring a program to life:"
