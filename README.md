# python
I will use this repository to collect my notes and programs as I learn python. I will have Ipython Notebooks that can be used for educational purposes, and collections of exercises for Rosalind Franklin. Below is a picture of me, 10 years of age, performing benchwork with my mother and her friend's kids. As you can tell, I have not been enthused by lab work from a young age, and don't let me tell you otherwise. I'm putting this image here as a reminder, that as much as I love science (Biology, Chemistry, Physics, all of it), I want to learn how to code, so that I'm not stuck behind a bench, pipetting all day.
